# Markdown parser

Simple Python script that reads a Markdown file and creates a dictionary based on the contents of the file, using the headings of the document as the keys... at least, that's what I'm trying to do while I get accustomed to Python 3.10.

The end goal is serving the contents of the markdown file over a webservice, using the main headers of the document as URL endpoints.
